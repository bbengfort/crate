## About

This project is intended mostly to show off a complete Go project that I wrote myself (my other Go projects are closed source, unfortunately) as part of my larger profile. It should demonstrate a systems program that interacts with the file system, uses a database, and performs network traffic. It is also useful to me, since I'm using it to extract and backup all the images my family has to a cloud service.

I also wanted to have some record of what a _good_ Go project looks like. It is routine for me to setup a quality Python library and deploy it on PyPi - but it's less clear about how to do that for Go. After researching other Go project libraries, this is what I came up with:

- A main.go that interacted with a self-contained library and used [CLI][cli]
- A test suite that uses [Ginkgo][ginkgo] and [Gomega](gomega)
- A Makefile that fetches dependencies and builds locally rather than on the $GOPATH

Together I hope this demonstrates to you and future me how to best set up a Go project, especially as I may be moving away from Go programming back to other languages at least in the immediate future.

### Name Origin

crate<br />
krƒÅt<br />
<small><em>noun</em></small>

1. a slatted wooden case used for transporting or storing goods.

    "a crate of bananas"

2. an old and dilapidated vehicle.

<small><em>verb</em></small>

1. pack (something) in a crate for transportation.

Ok, so I'm a bit of a nerd - but I was thinking about other projects like Box, Dropbox, S3, etc. Crate seemed like an appropriate name. Unfortunately there is already a [crate.io](https://crate.io/) which similarly is an elastic data store. My thing is more about storage and transportation, but hey - it's close! 

### Attribution

Crate does a lot of work on Images, and so it's only fair to specify the attribution of those images. For the test images in the fixtures directory, see the [README.md](fixtures/README.md) there. The header image in this README is attributed as follows:
